In this dialogue, Krishna provides both inspiration and counsel to Arjuna on a number of issues that are troubling him, including obligations, justice, and the nature of the world. Here are the five lessons that can be learnt from the Bhagavad Gita with specific verses, their translation, and how they can be effectively applied to our everyday activity.<\/p><p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>\u0938\u0902\u092c\u0902\u0927\u093f\u0924 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f<\/strong><\/p><p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dhaarmi.com\/?s=krishna\"><strong>Lord krishna<\/strong><\/a><\/p><h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><strong>\u092f\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u092a\u0922\u0947\u0902<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h5><h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dhaarmi.com\/gurus-saadhus-kathas-mythology-en\/daily-dhaarmi-bhagavad-gita-chapter-9-verse-22-meaning-and-verse\"><strong>Daily Dhaarmi : Bhagavad Gita Chapter 9, Verse 22: Meaning and Verse<\/strong><\/a><\/h5><h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dhaarmi.com\/gurus-saadhus-kathas-mythology-en\/daily-dhaarmi-bhagavad-gita-chapter-2-verse-47\"><strong>Daily Dhaarmi: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 47<\/strong><\/a><\/h5><h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dhaarmi.com\/gurus-saadhus-kathas-mythology-en\/daily-dhaarmi-bhagavat-geeta\"><strong>Daily Dhaarmi: Bhagavad Gita<\/strong><\/a><\/h5><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Verse 3.19<\/h1><p><strong><em>tasm\u0101d asakta\u1e25 satata\u1e41 k\u0101rya\u1e41 karma sam\u0101chara<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>asakto hy\u0101charan karma param \u0101pnoti p\u016bru\u1e63ha\u1e25<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Translation:<\/p><p>&#8220;Therefore, without attachment, always perform the work that has to be done; for a man attains the highest by doing work without attachment.&#8221;<\/p><p>Krishna then teaches Arjuna the principle of j\u00f1\u0101na karma, which means that Arjuna should fight and perform the required duty without thoughts of the consequences. Another way of working is Karma Yoga which in essence means working without having our-self being worried about the fruits of the actions we are doing because each one of us has a responsibility to take.<\/p><p>In day to day life this can be achieved by shifting our perspective to simply do our best in any particular assignment without concern for the consequences. It can apply to one\u2019s job, friendships, or any other challenges and goals, focusing on how much you tried and not how much it paid off can help fight stress and make you satisfied. For instance, a student should mark their calendar, study hard but not for the sake of getting high grades; an employee too should work hard without expecting promotions or a raise in pay.<\/p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Verse 2.38<\/h1><p><strong><em>sukha-du\u1e25khe same k\u1e5bitv\u0101 l\u0101bh\u0101l\u0101bhau jay\u0101jayau<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>tato yuddh\u0101ya yujyasva naiva\u1e41 p\u0101pam av\u0101psyasi<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Translation:<\/p><p>&#8220;Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage in battle for the sake of battle; thus you shall not incur sin.&#8221;<\/p><p>Krishna advises Arjuna to neither rejoice at victory nor grieve at defeat, nor at success and loss. Such mental stability is crucial for a person to carry out his duties with efficiency, free from fluctuations in emotions.<\/p><p>In practice it is about adopting a middle earth attitude to the vicissitudes of life. For example when experiencing success or failure should be composed. Meditation and mindfulness can assist in developing this stability and enable one to cope with stressful situations.<\/p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Verse 2.40<\/h1><p><strong><em>neh\u0101bhikrama-n\u0101\u015bho \u2019sti pratyav\u0101yo na vidyate<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>svalpam apyasya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Translation:<\/p><p>&#8220;In this path, there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm. Even a little practice of this discipline protects one from great fear.&#8221;<\/p><p>According to Krishna, true knowledge and discrimination is the way to advise what is right and wrong and also says that a small amount of knowledge is sufficient to get rid of the biggest fears and all evils in life. The path of wisdom or Jnana Yoga is the process of knowing the soul and knowing the truth about the existence of the universe.<\/p><p>This can be applied by practising self reflection and reading philosophical or spiritual material from time to time. It is true that spending more time thinking and maybe attempting to get to know oneself and the world may lessen people\u2019s anxiety and help them think through their actions more logically rather than out of fear and confusion.<\/p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Verse 9.34<\/h1><p><strong><em>man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>m\u0101m evai\u1e63hyasi yuktvaivam \u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 mat-par\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Translation:<\/p><p>&#8220;Focus your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, and bow down to Me. By doing so, you will surely come to Me. Truly, I promise you this, for you are dear to Me.&#8221;<\/p><p>Krishna also explains the principles of the 6th type of yoga called Bhakti Yoga which emphasizes the need to offer one\u2019s thoughts, actions, and feelings to a higher power. It is only natural for man to submit to a higher being and nurture friendship with it, this gives spiritual satisfaction.<\/p><p>This can be achieved by creating habits that relate to spirituality for instance praying, meditating or performing other religious activities that may be geared towards spirituality. A common example of this teaching is performing benevolences and dedicating the services to others.<\/p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Verse 4.7<\/h1><p><strong><em>yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101nir bhavati bh\u0101rata<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>abhyutth\u0101nam adharmasya tad\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 s\u1e5bij\u0101myaham<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Translation:<\/p><p>&#8220;Whenever there is a decline in righteousness and an increase in unrighteousness, O Arjuna, at that time I manifest Myself on earth.&#8221;<\/p><h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><strong>\u092f\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0947\u0902<\/strong><\/h5><h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dhaarmi.com\/gurus-sants-kathas\/lord-krishna-what-was-the-secret-of-the-friendship-between-lord-krishna-and-sudama\"><strong>Lord Krishna: \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923 \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u0941\u0926\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0915\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0925\u093e ? | Bhaiya ji maharaj<\/strong><\/a><\/h5><p>This verse points to the fact that the forces of good and evil are ever at war, and the need for the intervention of a higher power to prevail over evil forces.

Strengthening the perspective of not having desire for luxury also results in having a better and satisfied life. Habits and activities including minimalism, charity, and a more ethical way of living can contribute to weakening the hold of materialism.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse Hindu scripture in the epic Mahabharata, categorised as a dialogue between prince Arjuna and his charioteer Krishna.
