In this article, we will explore everything about Badrinath and will get a small guide on \u201chow to visit the place?\u201d<\/p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>History Associated with Badrinath<\/strong><\/h1><p>Back in the Ninth Century, a holy legend and a teacher of Advaita Vedanta named Adi Shankaracharya discovered a black stone image of Lord Badrinarayan from the Alaknanda River. It was believed to be made of black Shaligram stone. He established the stone in the Tapt Kund.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Later, in the sixteenth century, this stone murti was transferred to the present day Badrinath temple by the King of Garhwal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>When Does Badrinath Yatra Begin?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h1><p>Badrinath can experience unpredictable weather and unseasoned rainfall. This is why it becomes necessary to take necessary precautions like carrying enough warm clothes and other basic necessities. The temple is situated at a great height of Garhwal Himalayas and hence experiences relatively mild temperatures in Summers. Thus the time during late April to June is the most ideal season to begin the yatra to Badrinath.&nbsp;<\/p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Reach Badrinath From Various Locations?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h1><p>Badrinath is situated at an altitude of 3,100 metres (or 10,170 feet) in the Garhwal Himalayas on the banks of Alaknanda River.

If you choose to follow a specific route, the bus will take you to Haridwar first. Then you can change the bus and get to reach Joshimath from Rishikesh.&nbsp;<\/p><p>You can even book a taxi from Joshimath to reach Badrinath as this is a short distance of about 45 KMs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>You can also travel by train from Delhi to Haridwar and then can follow the descriptive route.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Haridwar:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2><p>Haridwar\/rishikesh is the common destination for everyone travelling to Kedarnath or Badrinath.

The temperature generally ranges from 15\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C in the summers.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Monsoon season (from July till September) experiences heavy rainfall and unpredictable dangerous thunderstorms.
