However, there are a few methods you can use to identify genuine rudraksha beads:<\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Look for surface texture: Real Rudraksha beads have a very rough surface; they are distinct with natural noname formation on its surface. Fake ones may be surface flat or slightly jagged but they can be distinguished because they look too polished.<\/li>\n\n<li>Check for mukhi (facets): Rudraksha beadsare classified by the number of faces or facets, known as \u201cmukhi\u201d, which are the physical lines on the bead that run down the middle from the top to the bottom. These are formed as a result of the compartments within the seed. The number of mukhis may be any, but the most frequent ascending is the five. Look at the following features of the mukhi: authentic rudraksha beads do not possess overlapping or ill-defined mukhi. While in the real ones, it is etched on them and may be difficult to distinguish it from the surface while in the fake ones the lines may seem to have been painted on.<\/li>\n\n<li>Float test: Rudraksha are seeds of trees with the same name. Hence, they are denser and can sink to the bottom of a bowl of water. Fake rudrakshas are usually made with wood, which have lighter density making them float. This method is not completely foolproof, hence is not a recommended method of distinguishing. But it can be considered one of the methods since the fakes are usually made from wood materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n<li>Check for color change: Outwardly, the natural genuine beads of rudraksha are unique; these may change mildly in color upon wearing, turning slightly darker as a result of absorption of natural skin oils. This method may take some time, but is also an effective method to know that you have bought a fake.<\/li>\n\n<li>Smell: Pure or original Rudraksha should have an aroma which is natural and reminds you of the earth. The fakes may not possess this smell or may smell different owing to the artificial smells which are electrically added.<\/li>\n\n<li>Consult an expert: If you are not sure that the rudraksha bead that you acquired is genuine, then it would be wise to seek professional help from a competent professional trader or user.<\/li><\/ul><p>It is however important to note that these methods are not conclusive, and thus it is always recommended to buy the Rudraksha from a trusted source.<\/p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is rudraksha mukhi?<\/h1><p>Rudraksha beads are actually in mythology with features or faces and they are identified as mukhis, and every mukhis have its own superior attributes and special powers according to Hindu mythology.
