The composition of the Hanuman Chalisa by Goswami Tulsidas Ji predates the creation of the Ramcharitmanas. This is because he wanted to achieve Lord Sri Ram by making Shri Hanuman Ji his Guru. The Chalisa, which consists of 40 verses, is said to not only bring religious benefits to those who recite it but also contains hidden principles of life management. If understood, it can bring success in every aspect of life.<\/p><p>Guidance from the Guru Shri Guru Charan Saroj Raj Nij Manu Mukura Sudhaari<\/p><p>The importance of the Guru is written in the first line of the first verse of the Chalisa. If there is no Guru in life, one may face difficulties in progressing. The Guru alone can show the right path. Parents are also considered the first Gurus. The Guru is the one who guides you on the right path. If you want to progress, respect the elders with humility.<\/p><p>Attention to attire Kanchan Baran Biraaj Subesaa, Kaanan Kundal Kunchit Kesa<\/p><p>In today&#8217;s world, your progress also depends on how you live and how you look. Even if you are very virtuous, not living well can affect your career. Therefore, always maintain good manners and dress well.<\/p><p>Being intelligent is also important Vidyavaan guni ati chaatur, Raam kaaj karibe ko aatur<\/p><p>In today&#8217;s era, having a good degree is very important. But the Chalisa says that just having a degree is not enough to be successful. Along with acquiring knowledge, you also need to enhance your qualities and bring intelligence in your decisions. Hanuman Ji possessed all three qualities &#8211; he was a disciple of the sun, virtuous, and intelligent.<\/p><p>Listen to everyone carefully Prabhu charit sunibe ko rasiya, Raam Lakhan Sita man basiya<\/p><p>What is your priority, what is your work, you should not only speak but also listen carefully to it. Being a good listener is very important. If you do not have the art of listening, you cannot become a good leader.<\/p><p>Faith in oneself and in God Prabhu mudrika meli mukh maahi, Jaldhi laanghi gaye acharaj naahi<\/p><p>If you have full faith in yourself and your God, you can easily accomplish any difficult task. There should be no lack of self-confidence in the era of competition. It is very important for the success of the work that you have complete faith in yourself and God.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hanuman Jayanti 2024: The Hanuman Chalisa, consisting of 40 verses, is considered the best hymn to seek the grace of Lord Hanuman according to religious beliefs.
